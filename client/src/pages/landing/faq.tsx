    question: "What is MCP and why does it matter?",
    answer:
      "Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard that lets AI agents discover and request capabilities securely. Instead of managing countless API keys, agents can authenticate once via OAuth and discover available resources through a standardized protocol.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does payment work?",
    answer:
      "We use instant custodial settlement in USDC on SUI. When an AI agent fetches content, the payment settles immediately and you receive a cryptographically signed receipt with proof.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are spending caps?",
    answer:
      "Suimo provides multi-level spending limits: global weekly caps, per-site daily caps, and per-mode caps. This ensures agents never overspend and gives you full control over your budget.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do content providers get paid?",
    answer:
      "Providers receive instant USDC payouts to their SUI wallet when agents access their resources. Payments are split automatically: provider gets their share minus platform fees, with full transparency via cryptographic receipts.",
  },
  {
    question: "What pricing models are supported?",
    answer:
      "Providers can choose between flat-rate pricing (fixed cost per fetch) or per-KB metered billing. You set your own rates and Suimo handles the metering, escrow, and settlement automatically.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from traditional APIs?",
    answer:
      "Traditional APIs require manual integration, API key management, and monthly billing. Suimo enables pay-per-use access with instant settlement, standardized discovery via MCP, and built-in authorization—no contracts or upfront commitments.",
  },
